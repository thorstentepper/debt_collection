### Project Title
Which Debts Are Worth the Bank's Effort?

### Description
This project analyses recovery strategies a bank may employ after certain debts
have been legally declared 'uncollectable'. Using a threshold assignment, the
analysis checks to what degree assigning customers to a higher recovery strategy
is profitable. After initial exploratory data analysis, statistical tests such
as the Kruskal-Wallis test and the chi-square test are performed to examine
effects of age and sex on expected recovery amount. Introducing the actual
recovery amount, regression analysis is performed with and without a threshold.
The threshold shows a statistically significant regression coefficient and points
to regression discontinuity (i.e. a leap in the recovered amount), indicating that assignment of higher recovery strategies becomes profitable at this point.

### Files used
